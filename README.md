# Scorched End Audio Library

SEAL is a C library with Ruby binding for audio rendering and manipulation,
such as direction and distance attenuation, the simulation of the Dopplet
effect and reverberation, in a 3D space. It is built on top of [OpenAL]
(http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/default.aspx), adding support for
audio streaming and audio formats like Ogg Vorbis, MPEG Audio and WAVE.

## Platforms

Linux, Windows and Mac OS X are officially tested and supported. SEAL should
run on all Unix-like operating systems where OpenAL, libogg, libvorbis and
libmpg123 can run, but those platforms are never tested. The Makefiles are
generated specifically for MSVC and GCC (MinGW or native Unix-like systems).

## Build

-   GCC + GNU Make + Unix-like operating systems + UN*X shell

    First, you need [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) 2.4 or later to install
    [libopenal](http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html) as follows:

        git clone git://repo.or.cz/openal-soft.git openal-soft
        cd openal-soft/build
        cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
        make
        make install

    Then download [libmpg123](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mpg123/files)
    and:

        cd <libmpg123_directory>
        ./configure
        cd src/libmpg123
        make
        make install

    Finally from SEAL directory:

        cd make/gcc/unix-like
        make

    Note: There has been issues compiling OpenAL on some versions of OS X
    because LLVM is the default compiler. I haven't had luck compiling
    OpenAL with LLVM, so I explicitly specified GCC instead:

        ...
        CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.2 cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
        ...

-   GCC + GNU Make + MinGW + UN*X shell

        cd make/gcc/win32
        make

-   MSVC + nmake + Command Prompt

        cd make/msvc/win32
        nmake

-   MSVC + Microsoft Visual Studio 2010

    use the solution and project files under /msvc.

-   Ruby extension

        $ cd ruby
        $ ruby configure.rb
        $ make

    The default output is `seal.{so,dll,bundle}`, which is a dynamic library
    that could be required by Ruby at runtime.

    If you are compiling on Unix-like operating systems other than Linux and
    Mac OS X, change the following check to pass whatever platform you have:

        if target_os =~ /mswin|mingw|<...>/

Note that Win32 binaries are shipped with the project for compiling SEAL on
Windows. You can of course compile your own copies of the dependency
libraries on Windows, but I feel like Win32 users do not usually do that.

## Thread Safety

SEAL can be safely used in a multi-threaded environment so long as no SEAL
source, buffer or stream instance is accessed by different threads at the
*same time* , which is similar to libvorbis' thread-safety conditions
described [here](http://xiph.org/vorbis/doc/vorbisfile/threads.html).

Exceptions are the two functions `seal_startup` and `seal_cleanup`, which are
*NOT* thread-safe. Refer to the documentation for these two functions for
details.

## Character Encoding

UTF-8 should be used to encode the source code or at least the path strings so
that SEAL can properly input audio files using paths that contain multibyte
(Chinese, Japanese, etc.) characters.

## Etymology

The phrase "Scorched end" (Chinese: 焦尾; Pinyin: Jiao Wei) is a direct
tranlation of the name of a Guqin[1] existed in China in the second
century CE. The name literally means that one end of the Qin is scorched.

This Qin was found by Cai Yong.[2] According to the "History of the Later
Han",[3] Cai Yong once heard very loud sound of someone burning Firmiana
simplex[4] wood for cooking and realized that it is a good material for
making Qin soundboards. He then asked for the wood and cut it into a Qin,
and the sound it produced was pleasant to hear as expected. However, one
end of the wood had already been scorched by the time Cai Yong got it,
hence the name "Scorched end".

SEAL was named so with the hope that it will be more useful than it seems
and will be discovered by the right people who need the right tool.
