# Scorched End Audio Library

SEAL is a C library with Ruby binding for audio rendering and manipulation,
such as direction and distance attenuation, the simulation of the Dopplet
effect and reverberation, in a 3D space. It is built on top of [OpenAL]
(http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/default.aspx), adding support for
audio streaming and audio formats like Ogg Vorbis, MPEG Audio and WAVE.

## Supported Platforms

Windows and Linux are officially supported. The third-party libraries are
redistributed in binary forms for 32-bit Windows only; Linux users are
expected to install the third-party libraries by themselves (since it is
so much easier than doing so on Windows). The Makefiles are generated
specifically for MSVC and GCC (MinGW or native Linux). In theory seal
is portable to all UN*X-like systems or even Darwin, but they are not being
tested at the moment.

## Build

-   GCC + GNU Make + Linux + UN*X shell

    install [libopenal]
    (http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/Downloads/Forms/AllItems.aspx)
    using CMake and [libmpg123](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mpg123/) using
    autoconf, then

        $ cd make/gcc/linux
        $ make

-   GCC + GNU Make + MinGW + UN*X shell

        $ cd make/gcc/win32
        $ make

-   MSVC + nmake + Command Promt

        > cd make/msvc/win32
        > nmake

-   MSVC + Microsoft Visual Studio 2010

    use the solution and project files under /msvc.

-   Ruby extension

        $ cd demo
        $ ruby configure.rb
        $ make
        
    The default output is `seal.{so,dll}`, which is a dynamic library that
    could be required by Ruby at runtime.

Note that only Windows binaries are shipped with the project.

## Thread Safety

SEAL can be safely used in a multi-threaded environment so long as no SEAL
source, buffer or stream instance is accessed by different threads at the
*same time* , which is similar to libvorbis' thread-safety conditions
described [here](http://xiph.org/vorbis/doc/vorbisfile/threads.html).

Exceptions are the two functions `seal_startup` and `seal_cleanup`, which are
*NOT* thread-safe. Refer to the documentation for these two functions for
details.

## Character Encoding

UTF-8 should be used to encode the source code or at least the path strings so
that SEAL can properly input audio files using paths that contain multibyte
(Chinese, Japanese, etc.) characters.

## Etymology

The phrase "Scorched end" (Chinese: 焦尾; Pinyin: Jiao Wei) is a direct
tranlation of the name of a Guqin[1] existed in China in the second
century CE. The name literally means that one end of the Qin is scorched.

This Qin was found by Cai Yong.[2] According to the "History of the Later
Han",[3] Cai Yong once heard very loud sound of someone burning Firmiana
simplex[4] wood for cooking and realized that it is a good material for
making Qin soundboards. He then asked for the wood and cut it into a Qin,
and the sound it produced was pleasant to hear as expected. However, one
end of the wood had already been scorched by the time Cai Yong got it,
hence the name "Scorched end".

SEAL was named so with the hope that it will be more useful than it seems
and will be discovered by the right people who need the right tool.
