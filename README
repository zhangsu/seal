-   What is SEAL?

    The Scorched End Audio Library (SEAL) is a C library (with Ruby binding)
    for 3D audio rendering and manipulation with built-in support for Ogg
    Vorbis, MPEG Audio and WAVE format. The major components of SEAL are based
    on OpenAL, a 3D sound rendering engine.

-   What Platforms and Compilers are Supported?

    Windows and Linux are supported. The third-party libraries are
    redistributed in binary forms for 32-bit Windows only; Linux users are
    expected to install the third-party libraries themselves. The Makefiles
    are written specifically for MSVC and GCC (MinGW or native Linux). In
    theory seal is portable to all UN*X-like systems, but it is only tested on
    Linux.

-   How to Build?

    To build with GCC on Linux, install libopenal and libmpg123 first and then
    run `make RELEASE=1` under /gmake/linux.

    To build with GCC + MinGW, run `make RELEASE=1` under /gmake/win32.

    To build with the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler, run `nmake` under /msvc.

    Note that these Makefiles do not add header dependencies for third-party
    libraries and other header files which are not expected to change.

    To build with the Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 IDE, use the solution file
    under /msvc.
    
    To build as a Ruby extension, run `ruby configure.rb` under demo (which
    generates a Makefile), then run `make`. The default output is `seal.*',
    which is a dynamic library that could be required by Ruby at runtime.

-   Is SEAL Thread-safe?

    SEAL can be safely used in a multi-threaded environment so long as no SEAL
    source, buffer or stream instance is accessed by different threads at the
    *same time* , which is similar to libvorbis' thread-safety conditions
    described at:
        http://xiph.org/vorbis/doc/vorbisfile/threads.html
	
    Exceptions are the two functions `seal_startup' and `seal_cleanup', which
    are *NOT* thread-safe. Refer to the documentation for these two functions
    for details.

-   What Character Encoding Should be Used?

    UTF-8 should be used to encode the source code, or at least the path
    strings, so that SEAL can properly input audio files using paths that
    contain multibyte (Chinese, Japanese, etc.) characters.

-   How Can I Redistribute SEAL?

    See COPYING.

-   Who is the Author?

    See AUTHOR.

-   What is Implied by "Scorched End"?

    The phrase "Scorched end" (Chinese: 焦尾; Pinyin: Jiao Wei) is a direct
    tranlation of the name of a Guqin[1] existed in China in the second
    century CE. The name literally means that one end of the Qin is scorched.

    This Qin was found by Cai Yong.[2] According to the "History of the Later
    Han",[3] Cai Yong once heard very loud sound of someone burning Firmiana
    simplex[4] wood for cooking and realized that it is a good material for
    making Qin soundboards. He then asked for the wood and cut it into a Qin,
    and the sound it produced was pleasant to hear as expected. However, one
    end of the wood had already been scorched by the time Cai Yong got it,
    hence the name "Scorched end".

    SEAL was named so with the hope that it will be more useful than it seems
    and will be discovered by the right people who need the right tool.
